# JavaScript Objects & Logic (HW-03) 🏗️

A foundational project focused on mastering object-oriented patterns in JavaScript, data structures, and complex logic implementation.

---

### 📝 Project Overview
This module dives deep into one of the most important concepts in JavaScript — **Objects**. The tasks involved creating and manipulating object properties, iterating through objects, and implementing practical logic for a small store or inventory system.

### 🔑 Key Implementations & My Work:
- **Object Manipulation:** Practiced adding, updating, and deleting object properties dynamically.
- **Iteration:** Used `for...in` loops, as well as `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, and `Object.entries()` to process data.
- **Data Aggregation:** Implemented functions to calculate totals (e.g., total price of products in a basket or total salaries).
- **Arrays of Objects:** Developed logic to find specific elements and extract values from collections of objects.
- **Spread/Rest Operators:** Applied modern ES6+ syntax for merging objects and handling multiple function arguments efficiently.

### 🚀 Learning Outcomes
* Understanding the difference between **primitive types and objects** (reference types).
* Mastering **methods within objects** (using `this`).
* Learning how to structure complex data for real-world applications.
* Improving problem-solving skills through algorithmic tasks.
